# Aider Plugin for Neovim

This is a simple plugin for Neovim that allows you to open a terminal window inside Neovim and run [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider). I wrote it as an experiment in using Aider which is by far the best AI coding assistant I've seen, and now just a few keystrokes away in vim.

## Installation

You can install the Aider Plugin for Neovim using various package managers. Here are the instructions for some common ones:

Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use 'joshuavial/aider.nvim'
```

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'joshuavial/aider.nvim'
```

Using [dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)

```vim
call dein#add('joshuavial/aider.nvim')
```

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "joshuavial/aider.nvim",
  opts = {
    -- your configuration comes here
    -- if you don't want to use the default settings
    auto_manage_context = true, -- automatically manage buffer context
    default_bindings = true,    -- use default <leader>A keybindings
    debug = false,              -- enable debug logging
  },
}
```

## Usage

The Aider Plugin for Neovim provides several functions and commands:

1. `AiderOpen`: Opens a terminal window with the Aider command.

   - Arguments:
     - `args`: Command line arguments to pass to `aider` (default: "")
     - `window_type`: Window style to use ('vsplit' (default), 'hsplit', or 'editor')
   - Note: If an Aider job is already running, calling AiderOpen will reattach to it, even with different flags.

2. `AiderAddModifiedFiles`: Adds all git-modified files to the Aider chat.
   - This function can be called directly or through the user command `:AiderAddModifiedFiles`

When Aider opens (through either function), it automatically adds all open buffers to both commands. It's recommended to actively manage open buffers with commands like `:ls` and `:bd`.

Examples of using these commands:

```vim
:AiderOpen
:AiderOpen -3 hsplit
:AiderOpen "AIDER_NO_AUTO_COMMITS=1 aider -3" editor
:AiderAddModifiedFiles
```

You can set custom keybindings for these commands in your Neovim configuration. For example:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>Ao', ':AiderOpen<CR>', {noremap = true, silent = true})
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>Am', ':AiderAddModifiedFiles<CR>', {noremap = true, silent = true})
```

Run `aider --help` to see all the options you can pass to the CLI.

The plugin provides the following default keybindings:

- `<leader>Ao`: Open a terminal window with the Aider defaults (gpt-4).
- `<leader>Am`: Add all git-modified files to the Aider chat.
- `<leader><space>`: Open Aider (Deprecated - will be removed in a future version)

These keybindings are set up using which-key, providing a descriptive popup menu when you press `<leader>A`.

## Setup

The Aider Plugin for Neovim provides a `setup` function that you can use to configure the plugin. This function accepts a table with the following keys:

- `auto_manage_context`: A boolean value that determines whether the plugin should automatically manage the context. If set to `true`, the plugin will automatically add and remove buffers from the context as they are opened and closed. Defaults to `true`.
- `default_bindings`: A boolean value that determines whether the plugin should use the default keybindings. If set to `true`, the plugin will require the keybindings file and set the default keybindings. Defaults to `true`.
- `debug`: A boolean value that determines whether the plugin should enable debug logging. When set to true, it will print debug information to help troubleshoot issues. Defaults to false.
- `ignore_buffers`: A list of matching patterns for buffer names that will be ignored. Defaults to `{'^term:', 'NeogitConsole', 'NvimTree_', 'neo-tree filesystem'}`.
- `border`: A table for styling the floating window border. Expected to contain two keys: `style`, a string or a table, and `color`, a string. See [Neovim API documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_open_win()) for more information on floating window border styling. Defaults to no border. If `border.style` is not defined, `border.color` has no effect.

Here is an example of how to use the `setup` function:

```lua
require('aider').setup({
  auto_manage_context = false,
  default_bindings = false,
  debug = true,
  vim = true, 
  ignore_buffers = {},
  border = {
    style = { "╭", "─", "╮", "│", "╯", "─", "╰", "│" }, -- or e.g. "rounded"
    color = "#fab387",
  },

  -- only necessary if you want to change the default keybindings. <Leader>C is not a particularly good choice. It's just shown as an example.
  vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>C', ':AiderOpen --no-auto-commits<CR>', {noremap = true, silent = true})
})
```

In this example, the `setup` function is called with a table that sets `auto_manage_context` to `false` and `default_bindings` to `false`. This means that the plugin will not automatically manage the context and will not use the default keybindings.


## Reloading buffers after Aider updates the underlying code

Run the `:e` command to re-edit the current buffer updating its contents with any changes made since initially loading it.

## Tips for Working with Buffers in Vim

If you're not familiar with buffers in Vim, here are some tips:

- Use `:ls` or `:buffers` to see all open buffers.
- Use `:b <number>` or `:buffer <number>` to switch to a specific buffer. Replace `<number>` with the buffer number.
- Use `:bd` or `:bdelete` to close the current buffer.
- Use `:bd <number>` or `:bdelete <number>` to close a specific buffer. Replace `<number>` with the buffer number.
- Use `:bufdo bd` to close all buffers.

## NOTE

if you resize a split the nvim buffer can truncate the text output, chatGPT tells me there isn't an easy work around for this. Feel free to make a PR if you think it's easy to solve without rearchitecting and using tmux or something similar.
